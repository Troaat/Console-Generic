# Console-Generic
This is just an open-source C++ library that I'm willing to develop.
It consists of classes for console, so that it's easier for people to create simple applications with a prettier display.
It's going to be something from which I can learn, and people can get an insight on certain aspects (it was my case).
Anything anyone wants to add/remove/merge/modify will be an addition to it, and of course I will be adding my own features at first.
It could be used for small console games as well, and that was my initial thought when I said to myself, "I should create a library".
